# Gap Opening Testing

## What is a Gap?

There are many forms of trading methods out there but a common denominator between many of them is finding a gap or a suspected gap between two price points and exploiting it. For instance, there are many people who trade earnings (the four times a year a public company is mandated to produce its balance sheets), as they suspect the price will have a gap (i.e. jump) up or down. Quite a few strategies will look at the data and assess what the high and low prices are for that company's stock and if the price rises or falls below those points they will trade that gap according to their methods.

## Gap Opening

Being that the market closes at 4 eastern standard time everyday, and there is often news regarding companies or the markets in general released after that, markets have evolved to have pre-trading and post-trading hours. Often prices at the end of one trading day are NOT the same as the next day’s opening price. This is called a gap, or a gap in price. When the market closes lower than the next days open it is called “Gap Up”, and inversely when the market closes higher than the next day’s open it is called “Gap Down”. Now there are many ways of looking at this gap such as assessing yesterday's highest/lowest price against today's open, Or even assessing the gap weekly instead of daily. But due to our limited resources this website will only work with assessing the gap between the markets close to markets open.

## Our Resource

When it comes to trading strategies, testing the strategy before investing is understandably vital. But often the ability to test said strategies are limited to a few case examples given in the course. One can always paper trade but that can be time restrictive and only works from the moment forth but wont get historical data. Our website is a free resource to test Gap Open trading strategy . The general strategy is, if the market gaps down buy shorts as the end of the trading day should be lower and vice-versa. We provide you the amount of days the market has gapped-up and gapped-down as well as a chart with the amount it gapped each day, a chart showing the profitable days as well as the losses days, and a total of how much would have been made trading gap opening for the year against the standard buy-and-hold for the year. You can access your history via the hamburger menu on the right side of the page. Good luck and lots of success!

## Notes

There are a few important notes. First, this website is not giving investing advice nor is it making any investment suggestions, we are merely providing a tool to help in your own research. Second, due to complications we currently don't include data for the days after dividends (only for stocks that give dividends), which can potentially be an important trading day. Third, we would like to remind youn that the site has not taken into account taxes and fees which can differ by time or individual.
